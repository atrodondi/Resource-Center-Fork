# Resource Center

## Description
We created a mobile responsive resource center for companies to store useful links and notes. Categories are designated by purple polygons, and can be clicked to open a modal filled with cards with links, descriptions and editing capabilities.

## Motivation
This site will make it easier to share and organize resources company-wide that don't fit easily into a typical file structure, or are constantly forwarded through emails. It will make enhance on-boarding new employees and is versatile enough to be personalized for any company.

## Future Improvements

- Add animations when category icons and cards render and/or for different forms and modals.
- Unique verification or invitation of company employees through email.
- Add recents tab unique to user, so the last ten item links clicked on or visited will appear.
- Add timestamp and user info to added resources, to make additions and edits more transparent.
